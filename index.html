<h1>Personal Information</h1> 
<p>Bachelor of Applied Science (Psychology), 3rd year</p> 
<p>I am Chinese by ethnicity and was born in Malaysia then moved to Singapore when I was 11. Growing up speaking predominantly English in school and in my household, English is my first language. I am also able to speak minimal Malay and Cantonese due to my upbringing in Malaysia.
I enjoy reading, going to the gym and cooking in my free time. </p> 
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I think there's always added value when you learn new things, especially outside of your usual area of expertise. As I am studying psychology, we don't learn anything IT related. I can definitely see the value of IT in terms of creating a mental health app, or even my own website for clinical practice and even how psychology can inform IT in terms of personalisation in user experience.</p>
<p>When I was choosing where to study Psychology in Melbourne, I heard from many people that RMIT focuses much more on the practical side of things rather than the theoretical. Convenience and accessibility were other factors as RMIT is in the city centre which is where I live. I also visited RMIT before applying and saw that it offered a lot of modern facilities and had many new buildings.</p>
<p>I hope to learn the basics of information technology through this course. The bulk of the assignments being group projects, I am also excited to listen in on other people's project ideas, their approach to IT and learning the basics of coding.</p>

<h4>Sexual Health Psychologist</h4>
<p>The role of this position is mainly to create a safe open dialogue and develop specialised treatment plans to resolve any sexual issues one may have. These sexual concerns include but not limited to STI diagnosis, erectile dysfunction, pain during sex, sexual anxiety, reduced libido, sex/porn addiction, sexual trauma healing and also support for different kinds of sexual and relationship practices.</p>
<p>It appeals to me because I have always been fascinated by how the physical, sexual and mental health are dependent on each other. Coming from an asian society thats very conservative, I've always been interested in exploring what sexual health entails, how to achieve it and what's stopping us from it. The most common route of specialisation for psychology has always been clinical psychology and though there still aren't nearly enough psychologists, sexual psychology is an added dimension on top of clinical psychology which I think makes things way more interesting.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>This job requires someone who is passionate about sexual health, respectful of peoples issues, desires and lifestyle preferences and prioritises safety, wellbeing and collaboration. It requires a general or clinical registration as psychologist with AHPRA, 2 years of experience post registration, sex and intimacy treatment experience, collaborative, verbal and communication skills. </p>
<h4>My current skills</h4>
<p>Currently I do not hold any practical job or volunteer experience. However, what I do have is passion for sexual and mental health and an open and respectful approach to things. I also strongly believe in creating a safe, open and non-judgemental space where both the patient and practitioner work together to develop a tailored treatment plan to figure out how we can both help each other.</p>
<h4>My plan</h4>
<p>I plan to do volunteer work and part time work during the second half of 2021 after I've graduated whether that is in Singapore or Melbourne (depending on covid). I hope this find work that is related to this field as that would provide the most relevant and insightful experience for this position. As for becoming a registered psychologist with AHPRA, I aim to get into and complete my honours and masters in sexual psychology in the next few years.</p>
<h1>Personality profile</h1>
<h4> Myer's-Briggs Test</h4>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81460919/112987995-e7338500-9195-11eb-8c8c-0ddf9144f41c.png"style="width:350px;height:800px;">
<p>The Myer's Briggs test revealed that my personality type imaginative, hardworking, reliable, patient and supportive. However, it also revealed that I could be prone to overloading myself, being too altruistic and reluctant to change. This could mean my desire to help can be abused by less scrupulous colleagues in a team setting. To avoid this as much as possible, I need to find responsible teammates who will do their part and not take advantage of me.</p>
<h4>VARK Questionnaire (learning style test)</h4>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81460919/113007546-e5bf8800-91a8-11eb-9877-fa01b9958f0f.png"style="width:500px;height:150px;">
<p>The VARK learning style test also revealed that I am a Multimodal (AK) learner. That means I value listening, discussing and practical real-life experiences. This means that I will use all sorts of methods to learn how to execute tasks. To be an efficient team, I would need teammates who are either of the same learning style or who all have the various other learning styles (visual, aural, read/write, kinesthetic).</p>
<h4>Big Five personality test</h4>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81460919/113008513-ad6c7980-91a9-11eb-87bb-860633d706b3.png"style="width:500px;height:150px;">
<p>The Big Five personality test also revealed that I score relatively similar on all traits except for Conscientiousness. This shows that I am very careful and diligent. When forming a team, I should take into account to find teammates who too are diligent in their work. </p>
<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The project is to create an all-in-one smartphone app for teletherapy by using the MIT App Inventor or other app development software. This app will function like a dating app but for patients and their potential therapists. It also includes other functions like self-monitoring dashboards and educational/motivational content. The target audience is anyone who may be seeking alternatives to in person therapy.</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>This project idea is a response to the lack of accessibility to therapy (physically and financially) and the difficulty of finding a therapist that is most suited to an individual’s needs and preferences. Individuals that are seeking therapy have to pay exorbitant prices for at least a few therapy sessions before getting a sense of whether the therapist is best suited for them.</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Therapists that sign up to this app will include their pricing, schedule, area of specialisation, experience and some personal. Patient’s will then be able to swipe right on the therapists they want to engage with. However, patients need not include information on their end, patients will only reveal information while they are talking to the therapist. The patient will be able to ask the therapist several questions via chat before deciding on which therapist to go with.</p>
<p>As for the actual teletherapy, it will be done via voice and video calling. Patients and their therapist will schedule sessions according to their availabilities.</p>
<p>Educational content will also be published related to mental health. </p>
<p>Self-monitoring dashboards will be implemented. This engages users to have an option to track their mood, symptoms and habits. Users can choose what they wish to monitor or as per advised by their therapist.</p>
<p>Notifications will also be implemented in order to consistently engage users to ensure progress. These notifications will include appointment reminders, logging of mood, symptoms and habits, new educational content and daily motivational/mental health</p>
<p>A security password will also be implemented and optional for users. Since conversations, calls and tracking of mood, symptoms will be documented in the app, the user will have the option to set up a password to log in every time.</p>
