<h1>Personal Information</h1> 
<p>Bachelor of Applied Science (Psychology), 3rd year</p> 
<p>I am Chinese by ethnicity and was born in Malaysia then moved to Singapore when I was 11. Growing up speaking predominantly English in school and in my household, English is my first language. I am also able to speak minimal Malay and Cantonese due to my upbringing in Malaysia.
I enjoy reading, going to the gym and cooking in my free time. </p> 
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I think there's always added value when you learn new things, especially outside of your usual area of expertise. As I am studying psychology, we don't learn anything IT related. I can definitely see the value of IT in terms of creating a mental health app, or even my own website for clinical practice and even how psychology can inform IT in terms of personalisation in user experience.</p>
<p>When I was choosing where to study Psychology in Melbourne, I heard from many people that RMIT focuses much more on the practical side of things rather than the theoretical. Convenience and accessibility were other factors as RMIT is in the city centre which is where I live. I also visited RMIT before applying and saw that it offered a lot of modern facilities and had many new buildings.</p>
<p>I hope to learn the basics of information technology through this course. The bulk of the assignments being group projects, I am also excited to listen in on other people's project ideas, their approach to IT and learning the basics of coding.</p>

<h4>Sexual Health Psychologist</h4>
<p>The role of this position is mainly to create a safe open dialogue and develop specialised treatment plans to resolve any sexual issues one may have. These sexual concerns include but not limited to STI diagnosis, erectile dysfunction, pain during sex, sexual anxiety, reduced libido, sex/porn addiction, sexual trauma healing and also support for different kinds of sexual and relationship practices.</p>
<p>It appeals to me because I have always been fascinated by how the physical, sexual and mental health are dependent on each other. Coming from an asian society thats very conservative, I've always been interested in exploring what sexual health entails, how to achieve it and what's stopping us from it. The most common route of specialisation for psychology has always been clinical psychology and though there still aren't nearly enough psychologists, sexual psychology is an added dimension on top of clinical psychology which I think makes things way more interesting.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>This job requires someone who is passionate about sexual health, respectful of peoples issues, desires and lifestyle preferences and prioritises safety, wellbeing and collaboration. It requires a general or clinical registration as psychologist with AHPRA, 2 years of experience post registration, sex and intimacy treatment experience, collaborative, verbal and communication skills. </p>
<h4>My current skills</h4>
<p>Currently I do not hold any practical job or volunteer experience. However, what I do have is passion for sexual and mental health and an open and respectful approach to things. I also strongly believe in creating a safe, open and non-judgemental space where both the patient and practitioner work together to develop a tailored treatment plan to figure out how we can both help each other.</p>
