<h1>Personal Information</h1> 
<p>Bachelor of Applied Science (Psychology), 3rd year</p> 
<p>I am Chinese by ethnicity and was born in Malaysia then moved to Singapore when I was 11. Growing up speaking predominantly English in school and in my household, English is my first language. I am also able to speak minimal Malay and Cantonese due to my upbringing in Malaysia.
I enjoy reading, going to the gym and cooking in my free time. </p> 
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I think there's always added value when you learn new things, especially outside of your usual area of expertise. As I am studying psychology, we don't learn anything IT related. I can definitely see the value of IT in terms of creating a mental health app, or even my own website for clinical practice and even how psychology can inform IT in terms of personalisation in user experience.</p>
<p>When I was choosing where to study Psychology in Melbourne, I heard from many people that RMIT focuses much more on the practical side of things rather than the theoretical. Convenience and accessibility were other factors as RMIT is in the city centre which is where I live. I also visited RMIT before applying and saw that it offered a lot of modern facilities and had many new buildings.</p>
<p>I hope to learn the basics of information technology through this course. The bulk of the assignments being group projects, I am also excited to listen in on other people's project ideas, their approach to IT and learning the basics of coding.</p>
